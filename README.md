Welcome to the Amazon Sales Analysis project! In this project, we delve into analyzing sales
data from Amazon to extract insights and trends that can help optimize sales strategies,
understand customer behavior, and improve business operations.

## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing Amazon sales records, including
information such as sales dates, customer details, product categories, and revenue figures. By
leveraging SQL queries and data analysis techniques, we aim to answer various questions and
uncover valuable insights from the dataset.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project consists of [insert number] rows of data, representing Amazon
sales transactions. Along with the sales data, the dataset includes information about customers,
products, orders, and returns. Before analysis, the dataset underwent preprocessing to handle
missing values and ensure data quality.

## Analysis Questions Resolved

During the analysis, the following key questions were addressed using SQL queries and data
analysis techniques:

1.What are the total sales made by each customer?
2.How many orders were placed in each state?
3.How many unique products were sold?
4.How many returns were made for each product category?
5.How many orders were placed each month(2022)?
6.Determine the top 5 products whose revenue has decreased compared to the previous year.
7.List all orders where the quantity sold is greater than the average quantity sold across all orders.
8.Find out the top 5 customers who made the highest profits.
9.Find the details of the top 5 products with the highest total sales, where the total sale for each product is greater than the average sale across all products.
10.Calculate the profit margin percentage for each sale

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) has been created to visualize the relationships between
the tables in the dataset. This diagram provides a clear understanding of the data structure and
helps in identifying key entities and their attributes.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a SQL environment set up to execute queries.
3. Load the provided dataset into your SQL database.
4. Execute the SQL queries provided within the repository to analyze the data and extract insights.
5. Tailor the analysis or queries according to your specific objectives and requirements.

## Conclusion
Through this project, our aim is to furnish valuable insights into Amazon sales trends, customer preferences, and other factors that shape e-commerce operations. By dissecting the dataset and addressing pertinent questions, we aspire to empower stakeholders to make well-informed decisions and refine their sales strategies.
